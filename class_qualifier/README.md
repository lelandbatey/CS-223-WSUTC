## Class Qualifier - Explanation

This "Class Qualifier" was a brief bit of code I had to create to get into this class. This was because I did not have the necessary pre-requisites (CS 122) to take CS 223, and as such had to get special permission from the professor teaching this class (Brian Lamarche).

His requirement for giving his say-so was that I write this brief bit of code that would build a simple binary search tree. This is the result.
