# November 6th Quiz Notes

## Given Study Questions:

### 1. Given several B-trees, insert this item.




### 2. Write pseudocode for k-d tree insertion (recursively)



### 3. Write pseudocode for B-tree depth first search

Assuming that the `B-tree` has a structure like this:

    Bnode:
        int k_array[order-1]
        Bnode* child_array[order]

    search(Bnode* node, int sVal){
        for (int i = 0; i < (order-2); i++ ){
            if (node.k_array[i] == sVal ){ // WE FOUND IT!
                std::cout << node.k_array[i] << std::endl;
            } else if ( node->k_array[i] > sVal){ 

    // The key is larger, so we know our value is smaller than the
    // key, so we recursively call search on the smaller element.
                
                search(node->child_array[i], sVal);
            } else {
                search(node->child_array[order-1]);
            }
        }
    }


### 4. Write hash function to store an element in a table of `HT` size

So this is pretty easy, *I think*.

    // Assuming our value is an integer, and our hash table is 
    // just a series of pointers to integers

    store_val_in_table(int ourVal, int* HT, int tSize){
        HT[ (ourVal%tSize) ] = ourVal;
        return HT;
    }


### 5. Define 3 ways to resolve hash collisions

1. Probing
    - Quadratic
        - Use math (like say, a quadratic function) to calculate an offset to check for open space
    - Linear
        - Where you look iteratively forward, checking for open space
2. Separate chaining
    - Each index in the table is actually a separate data structure like an AVL tree or something
3. Double hashing
    - Where you hash the result of the previous hash to find a new index to store it in


### 6. Using STL Map, count # of times you see `x` in a list (vector)


    // Assuming that our map is instantiated with both keys and
    // values as integers, e.g. `map<int, int> myMap`

    for (int i = 0; i < myVect.size(); i++){
        if (myVect[i] == x){
            if (myMap[x]) {
                myMap[x]++;
            } else {
                myMap[x] = 1;
            }
        } 
    }


### 7. Given a heap, insert x, delete x

- Insertion
    - Tack onto the end (assuming list-based implementation), then percolate up as appropriate
- Delete
    - Delete the root (only thing you're allowed to delete), then move the last item (assuming array) into root, then percolate down (by swapping with smallest children).
