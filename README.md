CS 223 - Fall 2013
==================

Leland Batey


## What is this?

This is the work I did while taking CS 223 at Washington State University Tri-Cities in the Fall 2013 semester.

## How to Interpret

This is intended to be:

1. A sample of some of the work that I've done
2. To show basic implementations of the given data structures

I cannot garuntee that this code will be beautiful. I can only garuntee that it did what it was supposed to in the class.

## Additional Info

Currently, there should be a document in each folder that gives the requirements for each assignment. You should read those to understand what each program does.

## File Formats

Each file of notes or program-requirements is in two file formats:

1. A plain-text markdown file
2. A pdf document

Each document was originally written in markdown in a plaintext editor (Vim, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc) and was then converted into a PDF using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). The layout of the PDFs is intended to make the documents the same size as an original Kindle Fire (the e-reader I use to read these notes). The Pandoc/LaTex template for this is in the `notes` folder at the root of this repository, named `tablet.latex`.
